DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THIS BENCHMARKS AND/OR RELATED RESULTS ARE INTENDED AS
A GUARANTEE OF WELL FUNCTIONING OR GOOD PERFORMING SOFTWARE. 
THIS BENCHMARKS ARE PART OF sime_verify PLUGIN, AND LIKE THE PLUGIN ITSELF, 
COMES AS THEY ARE WITH NO GUARANTEE AT ALL.

In this directory are reported some benchmark results,
actually a comparison between the system statistics obtained for 
a bunch of request for a signed message showing (when smime_verify is involved), 
and for non signed message showing. 
The goal is to point out some differences in performance, benchmarking an Roundcube 
installation in a basic way.
Two benchmark cases are covered:
 (A) - 10000 requests using 10 concurrents
 (B) - 10000 requests using 100 concurrents
Both cases are observed for signed and non signed messages.

For running this benchmarks, Apache Benchmark has been used, collecting general 
information about bench runs:

- results_100c_nosign.txt  ==> (A) bench with non signed messages 
- results_100c_sign.txt ==> (A) bench with signed messages 
- results_10c_nosign.txt ==> (B) bench with non signed messages 
- results_10c_sign.txt ==> (B) bench with signed messages 


AB supplies directly a .tsv file for further analysis, so some Gnuplot prints 
about serving time are available:

- st_100c_nosign.jpg ==>  100 concurrents, no signature
- st_100c_sign.jpg ==> 100 concurrents, signature
- st_10c_nosign.jpg ==> 10 concurrents, no signature
- st_10c_sign.jpg ==> 10 concurrents, signature



A few graphs has been generated, using Gnuplot from a dstat dump, to compare directly 
signed and non signed messages on the most important system statistics:

- cpu_100c.jpg ==> user cpu load, %, 100 concurrents
- cpu_10c.jpg ==> user cpu load, %, 10 concurrents
- diskr_100c.jpg ==> disk reads, bytes, 100 concurrents
- diskr_10c.jpg ==> disk reads, bytes, 10 concurrents
- diskw_100c.jpg ==> disk writes,  bytes, 100 concurrents
- diskw_10c.jpg ==> disk writes, bytes, 10 concurrents
